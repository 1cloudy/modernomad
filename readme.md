## Pre-requisites, system dependencies and environment setup intructions:

## First-time Setup
see [how-to-run](/how-to-run.md)

Modernomad is designed to integrate guests, residents and a broader community around a colivng house. Although a large portion of the functionality revolves around managing guests, the underlying ethos is one in which the reservation is the beginning of a shared experience and participation in a community. If you are just looking for reservation software, you could probably use this but you might be better off with something like [CheckFront](http://www.checkfront.com/) which seems to integrate nicely with custom sites, or even [AirBnB](http://airbnb.com).
