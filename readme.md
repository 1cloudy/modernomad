Modernomad is guest and event management software for coliving houses. 

## About 
Modernomad is designed to integrate guests, residents and a broader community
around a colivng house. Although a large portion of the functionality revolves
around managing guests, the underlying ethos is one in which the reservation is
the beginning of a shared experience and participation in a community. If you
are just looking for reservation software, you could probably use this but you
might be better off with something like
[CheckFront](http://www.checkfront.com/) which seems to integrate nicely with
custom sites, or even [AirBnB](http://airbnb.com).

  associated wth their account.
