	<h2>A Housing network for driven world changers</h2>
	<p>The Embassy Network is a private club for a new generation. It is a
	place to call home for professionals and creatives who travel the far
	reaches of the globe and the mind; a place to share a stimulating
	environment built around dynamic interaction, creativity, and intention,
	where members can travel and always be at home.</p>
	
	<p>As collaborative work spaces have changed the landscape of business,
	the Embassy Network pushes creativity to the next level - getting the
	right people in the room, outside of formality, to cultivate innovation
	like never before. Members have access to full-time and/or
	flexible-duration accommodations, and receive access to collaborative
	space, events, and a global community of like-minded individuals.</p>
