We look forward to seeing you at the Embassy on {{ day_of_week }}!

** Key Data **

The house is located at 399 Webster Street, San Francisco, CA, 94117. Access
to the house is via a keypad on the front door. The access code is "{{ house_code }}" (the
"#" at the end is important, make sure to enter it as well). Checkin is anytime
after about 1pm. You are free to arrive earlier but your bed may not be ready
yet.  

Our primary, sacred house rule is No Dishes in the Sink. Ever. Wash
immediately, dry, and put away. Thank you!

And speaking of food, all food and drink at the house is shared! So please help
yourself to anything in the fridges or cabinets: cook, eat leftovers, jump in
on a meal in progress, or take lunch with you. 

You can connect to any of the wireless access points named "Embassy..." you
see at the house. The wireless password for all access points is "netpositive."

Checkout is by 11am on your departure day so that we can cycle the sheets and
prepare for the next guest. Please strip your bed sheets on departure and throw
them down the laundry chute!
