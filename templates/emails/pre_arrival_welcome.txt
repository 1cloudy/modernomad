The house is located at 399 Webster Street, San Francisco, CA, 94117. Access

Our primary, sacred house rule is No Dishes in the Sink. Ever. Wash
immediately, dry, and put away. Thank you!

And speaking of food, all food and drink at the house is shared! So please help
yourself to anything in the fridges or cabinets: cook, eat leftovers, jump in
on a meal in progress, or take lunch with you. 

You can connect to any of the wireless access points named "Embassy..." you
see at the house. The wireless password for all access points is "netpositive."
