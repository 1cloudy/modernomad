<h3>Register a new account</h3>

<p>If you already have an account, you can <a href="/people/login?next=/reservation/create/">log in</a> instead. </p>

<p>Tell us a bit about yourself. It will take 5-10 minutes to answer these questions, but it will help us learn about you and help you connect with the other awesome people where you are staying. You only create your account once. After, you can log in and create future reservation requests with the same information. Thanks!</p>
