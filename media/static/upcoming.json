David Bourland, Jr. (1928\u20132000) proposed E-Prime as an addition to Alfred Korzybski's general semantics some years[when?] after Korzybski's death in 1950. Bourland, who had studied under Korzybski, coined the term in a 1965 essay entitled A Linguistic Note: Writing in E-Prime (originally published in the General Semantics Bulletin). The essay quickly generated controversy within the general semantics field, partly because practitioners of general semantics sometimes saw Bourland as attacking the verb 'to be' as such, and not just certain usages.</p><p><b>Sharing:</b>i could give a talk about the impact of E' on the communication habits of small children. </p><p><b>Discussion:</b>is purpose homogenous? is there one internal consistent set of principles for meaning? </p><p><b>Purpose:</b>a conference on bats, see this url: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/?from=olddocs</p>"}, {'headline': u'<h3>robbie schingler</h3>', 'startDate': '2012-10-08', 'endDate': '2012-10-15', 'text': u'<h3>space, nerd,</h3><p>2012-10-08 - 2012-10-15</p><p><b>Projects:</b>space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land space land </p><p><b>Sharing:</b>The colonization of Mars by humans is the focus of serious study because surface conditions, such as the availability of frozen ground water, make it the most hospitable planet in the solar system other than Earth. The Moon has been proposed as the first location for human colonization given its close proximity, but Mars has twice the gravity, more water (in ice form) and a thin atmosphere, giving it the potential capacity to host human and other organic life in more abundance than on the Moon. Both the Moon and Mars, as potential settlement sites, have the disadvantages of cost and risk associated with landing within gravity wells, which may make asteroids another option for early expansion of humans into the solar system.</p><p><b>Discussion:</b>how will conflicts play out on other planets? can we raise kids on other planets?</p><p><b>Purpose:</b>visiting family</p>'}, {'headline': u'<h3>robbie schingler</h3>', 'startDate': '2012-11-01', 'endDate': '2012-11-05', 'text': u'<h3>housing, lego</h3><p>2012-11-01 - 2012-11-05</p><p><b>Projects:</b>The Earth is much like its "sister planet" Venus in bulk composition, size and surface gravity, but Mars\' similarities to Earth are more compelling when considering colonization.
